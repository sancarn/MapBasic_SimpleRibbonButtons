Step 1. Make sure that FULL_RIBBON.MBO and FULL_RIBBON.DEF are in the main directory.
Step 2. Compile `Example1 - Simple.mb` (Ctrl+K)
Step 3. Open project file `Example1 - Simple.mbp` (Ctrl+J)
Step 4. Make sure to include the line `Module = FULL_RIBBON.MBO`. It should look like this: (Ctrl+L)

	[Link]
	Application = Example1 - Simple.mbx
	Module = Example1 - Simple.MBO
	Module = FULL_RIBBON.MBO

Step 5. Link the project

If all went well, you should now have an MBX :)
